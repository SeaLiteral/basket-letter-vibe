Sheep Monologue 1.3. Made by SeaLiteral (Lars Rune Præstmark) for the O2A2q jam, and for the Blossom jam in April 2023.

Parts of this credits screen are written by the people that it mentions. If you're playing this game in another language than English, it shows my own translations. So if you really need to know exactly what they mean, go get a legal translator, I'm not one myself.

Audio was initially left out due to recording issues. Now I've added self-voicing, although it might still struggle reading some words, and it obviously doesn't sing. I do have a recording of the song in English, but I want to make another recording of it and then do it in all three languages. I hope to do that and put it in the game, but it would probably be in October 2023 or later. I don't even know how much free time I'll have during that month.

Logo font: [color=blue]Back For the Bar[/color]. Made by myself, unreleased so far. And I tweaked some shapes manually while making the logo.

[color=blue]ENet[/color]
The Godot engine uses ENet, and includes it in builds by default. Since I haven't removed its functionality from my builds even though my game doesn't need it, here's the notice it wants me to include:

[color=blue]mbed TLS[/color]
Another thing Godot includes by default and I haven't bothered turning off even though I don't really need it is mbed TLS. That, just like the Roboto font, is under the Apache License:
