[color=blue]Basket Letter Vibe[/color] 1.0. This is a simple Visual Novel made in Godot, supporting features like rollback and history, based on Sheep Monologue. I am releasing it under the MIT license:

Note from Lars Rune Præstmark (known on some websites as SeaLiteral): Parts of this credits screen are written by the people that it mentions. If you're playing this game in Danish or Spanish, it shows my own [color=blue]translations, which are not necessarily perfect.[/color] (And if you're somehow seeing it in another language than Danish, Spanish or English, that probably means someone else translated them and this message). It's not the type of text I specialize in translating, so if you need to know exactly what they say, it's probably best to read the English version (either by setting the game to English or following the hyperlinks below) and perhaps hire a translator that actually specialises in that type of text. Just saying.

[color=blue]ENet[/color]
The Godot engine uses ENet, and includes it in builds by default. Since I haven't removed its functionality from my builds even though my game doesn't need it, here's the notice it wants me to include:

[color=blue]mbed TLS[/color]
Another thing Godot includes by default and I haven't bothered turning off even though I don't really need it is mbed TLS. That, just like the Roboto font, is under the Apache License:
